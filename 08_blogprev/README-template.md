## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have never used a box shadow before, and it is my first time to set box shadow in my code. Any feedback and suggestions for the whole code is highly appreciated.


### Useful resources

-(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me for setting box shadow position, blur radius and shade. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
