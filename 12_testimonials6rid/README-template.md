## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been doing the grid template areas property since this is the easiest technique for me as of the moment. Just learned also how to put background image on a cell and doing the background position for it. Any feedbacks and suggestions are highly appreciated.

### Continued development
 Still continue learning the property of grid-row and grid column property using span.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position) - This helped me for doing the background position of the quotation icon.
