# Hello there!

This is where I put all my practice/mock projects courtesy of [codewell](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges) and [FrontEndMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). Most of mock projects I made as of the moment are composed of HTML and CSS to improve my skills in basic foundations before I learn Javascript.
