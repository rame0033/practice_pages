### What I learned

I recently finished my web development I course from my college so I tried the first time to use frontend mentor to keep me on track and practice what I've learned. I learned to use comment everytime on my code so that I keep track on which parts I've made and the use of modular scaling for texts instead of pixels.

### Continued development

I believe there are still inconsistencies with my spacing so I keep practicing with the right margins and padding.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.modularscale.com/?1&em&1.5) - This helped me how to use proper font sizing for headings and paragraphs
