## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to apply here what I learned from the feedbacks I got from my last two attempts on blog page and qr code challenges. 

### Continued development

I am still learning on using less pixel unit and implementing percentage, vh, vw, rem, and em as measurement. Also, still learning for proper flex and grid alignments. All feedbacks and suggestions are highly appreciated.
